# Capstone1_Proposals
Collection of proposals for Galvanize DSI Capstone 1

  
  
  ## Proposal 1:  M:tG Metagame Analysis  
   * [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com) - a community-created database of all Magic: the Gathering cards with an API
   
   * [TCGPlayer](https://tcgplayer.com) - a trade website for both official storefronts and individual sellers with an API
   
   * [MTG Goldfish](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/) and [MTG Top 8](http://mtgtop8.com) -- 2 websites that attempt to analyze metadeta without APIs
   
      ### Example EDA: 
      * Distribution of prices by color (a card characteristic)
      * Distribution of card types in meta decks (popular deck archetypes)
      * Correlation of keywords to prices
      ### Example Hypothesis Test:
      * The cards with the largest meta share have the highest price points.
      * Older cards in a format have the highest meta share
        This idea is more ambitious, as I would have to utilize multiple APIs to gather data, but it is more familiar and relates to a topic I quite enjoy. 
    
  ## Proposal 2: Kickstarter Projects
   *  [Kickstarter Projects](https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects)
      ### Example EDA:
      * Distribution of project success across goal amounts
      * Distribution of engagement(as # of donations) across categories
      ### Example Hypothesis Test:
      * The projects with the greatest *number of donations* have the greatest rate of success.
    
  ## Proposal 3: Warcraft Logs
  * [Warcraft Logs](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/)
      The group content of WoW is structured such that there are 3 roles players may take. Warcraftlogs is a website that aggregates self-reported data by reading the combat log (client-server events) from players who elect to upload. The website is curated entirely by one individual, but has 2 APIs to choose from. Works on summary statistics of those combat logs reaching back several years (roughly 2013) and allows viewing the individual logs directly as well.
